====================================

This is the repository for reproducibility part for the poster presentation at the launch of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at Sutardja Dai Hall. The Data Science Faire will be held from 1 to 3pm on 12th Dec, 2013.


In this part, we will mainly discuss the current research on data science regarding reproducibility as well as experiences in the course Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science offered by the Statistics Department in Fall 2013 from the students' point of view. 


In this repo, you will find the summary statistics from students' responses regarding their experiences during the course with reproducibility as well as the tools they have been involed with. The information here is a main part of the course outcome and is benefit to future educators for researching on developing structures of data science courses.
